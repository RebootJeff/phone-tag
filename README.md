5. Wait for players to join.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to tag players while avoiding getting tagged. There are no teams. Those friends I told you to get in step 1 are now your enemies. The map helps you find your enemies. The power-ups help you in various ways. Your ability to run is crucial, but your knowledge of the real-life play environment could come in handy. Please do not chase/lure players into busy streets. That's frowned upon with some major curvature.
